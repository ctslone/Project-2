# Rising Tide Reviews

Rising Tide is an full stack web application that allows users to vote on a variety of films using an organic scoring system, dubbed "up-boat and down-boat" which is more implicit than a rating based on an arbitrary number (5/10, 7.4/10, etc).

The motivation behind this app was to create a more binary movie recommedations site where the only contributing factor to a movie's rating is whether or not a user liked the movie. This rating system aims at removing the problem of "over-complicated" movie reviews which can sometimes deter a consumer from watching them and utilizes a "would you watch it?" type of system.

Some notes to help you have the best user experience:

- You can see all previously recommended movies on the home page
    - You can filter by popularity, new, title and release year
    - You can "up-boat" and "down-boat" any movie that you have seen and want to review
- If you would like to recommend a movie, you can do so on the movie search page where you can search for your desired movie
    - If the movie you search has already been recommended by another user, there is no option to add it again. Instead you can provide your review in the form of a vote
